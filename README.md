# HarpPreview

This is the html output of the Preview Edition ruby application built by Robin Sloan. 

## Additions and Notes

Preview Edition only generates html ouput locally. This includes the output and a simple PHP file that can be deployed on Heroku or other cloud services.

## Special Thanks

Thanks again to the creator for building a better way to read a book online, which in this case is a better preview that Amazon uses for ebook.
